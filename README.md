## **Critical Path Analysis**

### **Primary Dependencies:**
1. **Landlord Access** → Infrastructure Installation
2. **Layout Finalization** → Equipment Line Planning  
3. **Internet Installation** → All Equipment Connectivity
4. **Basic Infrastructure** → Security Systems
5. **Security Systems** → Final Operations

### **Resource Optimization:**
- **Thiago (Technical Lead):** 90% of implementation tasks
- **Emery (Project Manager):** Strategic decisions and final documentation
- **Parallel Processing:** Security and equipment lines can run simultaneously
- **Critical Bottlenecks:** Internet provider setup, landlord coordination

### **Risk Mitigation:**
- **Buffer Time:** 5-week extension from original August 1 deadline
- **Backup Internet:** Starlink system for redundancy
- **Staged Implementation:** Phased equipment connection to minimize downtime
- **Documentation:** SOPs created before final transition

### **Success Metrics:**
- All 67 tasks completed by September 6, 2025
- Zero operational downtime during transition
- Full connectivity for all production equipment
- Complete security and access control implementation
